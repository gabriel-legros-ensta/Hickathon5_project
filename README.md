# Hi!ckathon #5 - AI & Sustainability: Water Shortage Prediction
Welcome to my Hi!ckathon #5 project! This challenge combines the power of AI and Data Science to address a critical issue: sustainable water management.

About the Hi!ckathon
The Hi!ckathon is an AI and Data Science competition organized by Hi! PARIS, a center dedicated to AI and Data Science established by HEC Paris and the Institut Polytechnique de Paris, joined by Inria in 2021.

This competition is open to students from Institut Polytechnique de Paris, HEC Paris, and other universities in France and internationally.

Event Details
Preparation Phase: A 3-week pre-H!ckathon program with Data Science courses, business pitch training, and a Career Fair.
Final Sprint: November 29th to December 2nd, 2024.
